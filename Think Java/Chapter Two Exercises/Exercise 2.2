Exercise 2.2 The point of this exercise is (1) to use string concatenation
to display values with dierent types (int and String), and (2) to practice
developing programs gradually by adding a few statements at a time.
1. Create a new program named Date.java. Copy or type in something
like the hello world program and make sure you can compile and run it.
2. Following the example in Section 2.4, write a program that creates vari-
ables named day, date, month, and year. The variable day will contain
the day of the week (like Friday), and date will contain the day of the
month (like the 13th). What type is each variable? Assign values to
those variables that represent today's date.
3. Display (print out) the value of each variable on a line by itself. This is an
intermediate step that is useful for checking that everything is working
so far. Compile and run your program before moving on.
4. Modify the program so that it displays the date in standard American
format, for example: Thursday, July 16, 2015.
5. Modify the program so it also displays the date in European format. The
Final output should be:
American format:
Thursday, July 16, 2015
European format:
Thursday 16 July 2015

public class MyClass
{
 
    /**
     * Constructor for objects of class MyClass
     */
    public MyClass()
    {
        String day = "Thursday";
        String date = "24";
        String month = "December";
        String year = "2020";
        System.out.println("American Format:");
        System.out.println(day + ", " + month +' ' + date +", " +year);
        System.out.println("European Format:");
        System.out.println(day + " " + date + " " + month + " " + year);
    }

  
}
